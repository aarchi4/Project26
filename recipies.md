
For the Lemon Raspberry Cupcakes:

Step1:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees (F).
Step2:  Line 2 cupcake tins with paper liners; set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl using a handheld electric mixer, beat the butter, vanilla extract, lemon extract, sugar, and lemon extract, sugar, and lemon zest on medium-speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Step3.  Add in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. On low speed, beat in the sour cream, then the milk. Turn mixer off. 
Step4:  Add in 3 and 1/4 cups of the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Use a fork to lightly toss the dry ingredients together. 
Step5:  Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the dry ingredients into the batter, mixing just until combined. Be sure not to over mix here or your cupcakes will be dense!
Step6:  Set aside. In a small bowl combine the remaining 3 tablespoons of flour with the raspberries; toss to coat. 
Step7:  Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the raspberries and any excess flour into the batter, stirring just until combined. Spoon batter into prepared cupcake tins (filling each mold 3/4 of the way). Bake one pan at a time, for about 22 minutes, or until a cupcake tester inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, or with just a few moist crumbs attached. 
Step8:  Cool in the pan for 10 minutes then transfer cupcakes to a cooling rack. Cool completely before frosting.


For the Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting:
Step1:  In the bowl of a stand-mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl using an electric handheld mixer, beat the cream cheese, butter, and lemon extract on medium-high speed until completely smooth; about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the sifted confectioners' sugar.
Steo2:  Add in the lemon juice and zest. Once incorporated, increase speed to medium-high and beat for 1-2 minutes.
Step3: Once the cupcakes have completely cooled, spread or pipe the frosting on top of the cupcakes.
Step4: Decorate with fresh raspberries and a lemon slice, if desired.
